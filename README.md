# Liberty-Lib

This is a project showcasing a library management system, developed in Java using microservices architecture. The
system is divided into microservices, including services for user management (login, authentication, authorization,
etc.) and library management (book registration, loans, returns, renewals, fines, etc.). The user interface was
developed using Angular. The system is open source, allowing the community to make modifications and
improvements. The main goal is to contribute to better library management and organization.
